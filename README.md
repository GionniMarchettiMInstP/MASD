# MASD
##  Unsupervised Machine Learning Pipeline for Noisy High-dimensional Spectral Data
This repository contains two Python scripts that implement an unsupervised machine learning (ML) pipeline called MASD (Metrics Analysis of Spectral Data) developed under the supervision of professor Giancarlo Franzese (University of Barcelona, Spain). It also contains a dataset, named dataset_fibrinogen, of spectral data of the following type: UV Resonant Raman (UVRR), Circular Dichroism (CD) and UV Absorbance (Abs.) spectra, obtained from  Elettra Sincrotone Trieste facility, at Trieste (Italy).
