# MASD

## MASD (Metrics Analysis of Spectral Data) is an Unsupervised Machine Learning Pipeline for Noisy High-dimensional Spectral Data that can help quantify conformational changes of protein from its composite spectra in a end-to-end fashion
This repository contains two scripts in Python that implement a general unsupervised machine learning (ML) pipeline called MASD (Metrics Analysis of Spectral Data) developed under the supervision of professor Giancarlo Franzese (University of Barcelona, Spain). It also contains a dataset, named dataset_fibrinogen, of spectral data of the following type: UV Resonant Raman (UVRR), Circular Dichroism (CD) and UV Absorbance (Abs.) spectra, obtained from  Elettra Sincrotone Trieste facility, at Trieste (Italy). This ML methodology has been tested
with spectra of Fibrinogen (Fib) in solution, and also with Fib in presence of of either (Carbon) CNP nanoparticles or (Silica) SiNP nanoparticles. Details about the findings can be found in the following paper:
